## 1st and 2nd Year Python Course for Medical Students

This lecture set aims to provide the student with a clean development environment,
including Python installation and essential packages. We'll also introduce the 
Python & IPython shells and the **Jupyter notebook**.
In case you cannot install Python/Anaconda in your computer, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb). 

### [Introduction](lessons/programming/02-introduction.md)

We introduce here Python, a powerful and easy to learn programming language. It
has *efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach
to object-oriented programming* (Python website). However, we'll only
cover the strict minimum necessary for getting started with numerical computing.
