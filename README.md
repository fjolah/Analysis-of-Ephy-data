### [Installation](lessons/programming/01-installation.md) (If you wish to have Python in your computer)

This lesson aims at providing the student with a clean development environment,
including Python installation and essential packages, a decent text editor, and
a shell. We'll also introduce the Python & IPython shells, the **Jupyter notebook**
and explains how to run a python script from the command line.
In case you cannot install Python/Anaconda in your computer, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb). We've added a short tutorial on how to use Colab in [here](lessons/programming/colab_steps.md).

### [Introduction](lessons/programming/02-introduction.md)

We introduce here Python, a powerful and easy to learn programming language. It
has *efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach
to object-oriented programming* (Python website). However, we'll only
cover the strict minimum necessary for getting started with numerical computing.
